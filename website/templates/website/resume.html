            <p>Software engineer with 4 and half years of industry experience with Python, PHP and Javascript.
            Currently working as a software engineer at Juwai.com at Shanghai, China</p>

            <p>I think of programming languages as tools to solve problems and hence I am not too attached to any one programming language.
            Throughout my career I have used programming languages that best suited the job at hand. I do slightly prefer python over other languages because of it's ease of use.</p>

            <p>I enjoy solving logical problems and making video games in my spare time.</p>

            <h3><i class="fa fa-id-card" aria-hidden="true"></i> Experience</h3>
            <p>My first job was at Dragonsoft Research, Malaysia where I worked as an application programmer.
                Working here gave me much needed Industry experience and greatly improved my coding skills.
                In the two years that I spent working here I have gained valuable industry knowledge.
                While working here I cultivated great interest in the finer aspects of Web Development and this led to my next job.</p>

            <p>My second job took me to Shanghai,
                the business capital of the east.
                I started working for a company called Daily Fresh as a senior web developer.
                My job here was to make a POS System on an Android device.
                To accomplish this task I used a multitude of technologies such as Cordova, Ionic, the MEAN stack and AngularJS.
                Using these technologies gave me a deep insight into the JavaScript eco-system.
                However after finishing this project there was nothing much do other than general IT tasks and I felt like
                I wasnâ€™t growing as developer doing them and so I have started looking for other job opportunities where I can keep improving as Web Developer.</p>

            <p>Currently I am working at Juwai as a Software Engineer, here I develop and maintain core systems for juwai-admin which is a
                custom cms for the main juwai.com website. I have gained a lot of experience with Laravel and Nodejs while working here
                and hope to keep improving my skills to become a better developer.</p>
